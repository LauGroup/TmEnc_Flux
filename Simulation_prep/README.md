This folder contains topologies, coordinates and input files used to initiate simulations
Each structure is prepared with:

 pdb4amber -> tleap -> [parmed] -> equilibration -> production


Some legacy simualtion files on tape files may have names different to those found in the paper:

| Name in sims | Name in paper |
|--------------|---------------|
| M2           | S7G           |
| M7           | S7D           |
| M8           | S5D           |
| P52/M15      | S1K           |
| P53/M18      | S1R           |
| M26          | S3E           |
| M29          | S6E           |

These are consistent with an older naming scheme. This table is retained for backwards compatibility.
